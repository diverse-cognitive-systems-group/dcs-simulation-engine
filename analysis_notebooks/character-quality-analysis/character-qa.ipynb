    "\n",

This provides an initial, unstructured assessment of the character’s behavior, capabilities, and overall feel, and allows the researcher to become familiar with the character and update the character sheet with salient observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, general trends and observations are documented, with reference to prior evaluations where applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the character is evaluated along specific dimensions for each of the core games, including counterfactual coherence, long-horizon coherence, contextual generalization, adversarial robustness, and theory-of-mind performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a summary assessment of the character’s representational quality is added to the character sheet and submitted for review."
