# Foundational Analysis

Contains the manual analysis of the DCS Simulation Engine including usability, quality, core tasks, and characters. 

Each component is designed to evaluate specific aspect of the engine's performance and user experience.

Each analysis is self-contained and only relevant analyses are re-run and added as new ...for example

FOr example upon major interface changes, the usability analysis is re-run and updated to reflect the new user experience. Upon character changes/additions the character coverage and perhaps simulation quality analyses are updated to reflect the new character's performance and coverage in the simulation.
