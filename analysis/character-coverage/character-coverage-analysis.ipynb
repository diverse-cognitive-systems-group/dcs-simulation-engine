    "\n",
    "To evaluate the coverage of our character dataset, its useful to define a set of dimensions along which cognitive diversity can be categorized. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Because categorization is inherently subjective and dynamic, the number and type of categoies or dimensions may evolve over time. We justify our choice of dimensions against existing literature on cognitive systems across a variety of fields including psychology, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and philosophy of mind. We also attempt to clearly define the anthropocentric biases that may influence our categorizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we consider the following ten dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ontological Type / Existence (How is it described colloquially? What kind of system is it? Eg. living, biological, artificial, hybrid, individual, collective, distributed)\n",
    "2. Origin & Evolution (Where does it come from, and how does it change?)\n",
    "3. Motivation & Goal Source (Why does it act, and who sets its goals?)\n",
    "4. Goal Complexity (How ambitious or complex are its objectives?)\n",
    "5. Memory, Learning, and Cognition (How does it store knowledge and learn?)\n",
    "6. Communication & Perception (How does it sense and communicate?)\n",
    "7. Temporal & Processing Characteristics (How does it perceive and act over time?)\n",
    "8. Agency & Autonomy (How independent is it?)\n",
    "9. Embodiment & Substrate (What form and medium does it exist in?)\n",
    "10. Scale of Operation (At what level does it operate? Individual, collective, planetary?)"
